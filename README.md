# Production Project
This project is prototype for a manufacturing plant. It has a database which stores products that
 are producible and stores the record of the production, including the products serial number and
  date produced. <br/>
This project was a semester long project for COP 3003, Object Oriented Programming. The purpose of
 this project is to demonstrate a working knowledge of concepts like encapsulation, polymorphism, 
 inheritance, and abstraction.
